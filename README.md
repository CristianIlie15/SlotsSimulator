# SlotsSimulator
A JavaScript replica of a fruit slot game that incorporates randomness, payout calculations, and line checks. It features symbols like Cherry and Watermelon, scatters, and tiered payouts. Built with functions and data structures to simulate and calculate game results.

I suggest running the code online, on a JavaScript compiler and have your fun with it. It's the early version so far, I was focusing only on making the game logic work.

I m sorry if most of the variable or function naming doesn't seem familiar to you, but I'm romanian  .
